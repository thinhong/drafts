The amount of money after 1 week is:\n\n$$P_1 = P_0 \\times (1 + r)$$\n\nAfter 2 weeks\n\n$$P_2 = P_1 \\times (1 + r) = P_0 \\times (1 + r) \\times (1 + r)$$\n\n$$P_2 = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^2$$\n\nAfter t weeks\n\n$$P_t = P_0 \\times (1 + r)^t$$\n\nThere is a trader who is very good at trading. He start with $4000. Every week he earns 5% interest. In a year (52 weeks) he will earn:\n\n$$P_\\text{1 year} = P_0 \\times (1 + 0.05)^{52} = 12.6 \\times P_0$$\n\nAfter 2 years (104 weeks):\n\n$$P_\\text{2 years} = P_0 \\times (1 + 0.05)^{104} = 159.8 \\times P_0$$\n\nIf the interest rate is 5%, let vary the interest rate from 3-5%:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nInterest rate: 3%\n1 year: 18,603\n2 year: 86,522\n3 year: 402,408\n\nInterest rate: 4%\n1 year: 30,746\n2 year: 236,334\n3 year: 1,816,606\n\nInterest rate: 5%\n1 year: 50,571\n2 year: 639,362\n3 year: 8,083,336\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nSo you need to maintain a 3-5% interest every week, and you'll be rich after 3 years.\n",
