Let $P_0$ is the initial balance, $r$ is the interest rate in 1 week. The amount of money after 1 week is:

$$P_1 = P_0 \times (1 + r)$$

After 2 weeks

$$P_2 = P_1 \times (1 + r) = P_0 \times (1 + r) \times (1 + r)$$

$$P_2 = P_0 \times (1 + r)^2$$

After t weeks

$$P_t = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t$$

There is a trader who is very good at trading. He start with $4000. Every week he earns 5% interest. In a year (52 weeks) he will earn:

$$P_\text{1 year} = P_0 \times (1 + 0.05)^{52} = 12.6 \times P_0$$

After 2 years (104 weeks):

$$P_\text{2 years} = P_0 \times (1 + 0.05)^{104} = 159.8 \times P_0$$

If the interest rate is 5%, let vary the interest rate from 3-5%:

```{r echo=F}
pv <- 4000
r <- c(0.03, 0.04, 0.05)
for (ir in r) {
  cat(paste0("Interest rate: ", 100 * ir, "%\n"))
  for(i in 1:3) {
  cat(paste0(i, " year: ", formatC(pv * (1 + ir)^(52*i), format="d", big.mark=","), "\n"))
  }
  cat("\n")
}
```
So you need to maintain a 3-5% interest every week, and you'll be rich after 3 years.
